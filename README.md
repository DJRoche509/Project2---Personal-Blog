# Project2-LuxuryCar-Blog

This project was tasked to design a "**responsive**" website without using any external frameworks.
I chose to mainly use CSS grids over flexbox because I thought it was a better and easier option to help
keep the contents organize. 

### -- Design --
The general pattern of the webpage is as follows:
- Blog Homepage
  -  Navbar
  -  Blog Post Card
     - Card
     - Image
     - Buttons
  -  Footer
- Blog Post
  -  Header
  -  Author Info
     - Name
     - Title
     - Current Company/School
     - Short Bio
     - Avatar
- Social Sharing
  - Twitter
  - Facebook
  - LinkedIn
